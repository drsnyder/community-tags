## Running

You'll need to create a `dev-config.edn` with the following before you can run
the server. The config of primary concern is the `:neo4j-url`.

```
{
  :dev true
  :port 3000
  :nrepl-port 7000
  :neo4j-url "http://neo4j:your-password@localhost:7474/db/data/"
}
```

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run 

Alternatively you can start the server from the repl with:
```
lein repl
> (start)
```
